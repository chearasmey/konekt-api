REST Client Application: Requirements Document

1. Introduction
   1.1 Purpose
   This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for a modern, visually appealing REST client application. The application will provide developers with a comprehensive tool for making, testing, and managing HTTP requests efficiently.

1.2 Scope
The project will deliver a standalone web application built using React, Shadcn/UI, and Tailwind CSS. The initial version will focus on core request-making capabilities, request management through collections, and a polished user interface with theme switching. All data will be stored locally in the browser for this version.

1.3 Target Audience
The primary audience for this application is web and software developers who need to interact with and test APIs as part of their development workflow.

2. Functional Requirements
   2.1 HTTP Request Capabilities
   2.1.1 Methods: The client must support the following standard HTTP methods:

GET

POST

PUT

DELETE

OPTIONS

2.1.2 URL Input: Users must be able to enter a URL for the API endpoint.

2.1.3 Request Body: For methods that support a body (POST, PUT), the user must be able to specify the body content. The following formats must be supported:

JSON: A rich editor with syntax highlighting for JSON.

Multipart/Form-Data: An interface to add key-value pairs, including file uploads.

Form URL Encoded: An interface to add key-value pairs.

Raw Text: A simple text area for any raw text input.

2.1.4 Headers: Users must be able to add, edit, and remove custom HTTP headers as key-value pairs.

2.1.5 Query Parameters: The UI should provide a dedicated section for users to add, edit, and remove URL query parameters as key-value pairs. These should be automatically appended to the request URL.

2.2 Response Handling
2.2.1 Response Display: The application must display the response from the server in a clear and readable format. This includes:

Status Code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).

Response Headers.

Response Body, with syntax highlighting for common formats like JSON and HTML.

Time taken for the request.

2.2.2 Copy Functionality: Users should be able to easily copy the response body and headers to their clipboard.

2.3 Request Management (Collections)
2.3.1 Create Collection: Users must be able to create named collections to group related API requests.

2.3.2 Save Request: Users must be able to save a configured request (URL, method, headers, body, etc.) to an existing collection.

2.3.3 View Collections: A sidebar or dedicated panel should list all created collections and the requests within them.

2.3.4 Load Request: Clicking on a saved request within a collection should populate the main request interface with its saved configuration.

2.3.5 Delete: Users should be able to delete individual requests and entire collections.

2.4 Theming
2.4.1 Mode Switching: The application must provide a toggle to switch between a light (normal) mode and a dark mode.

2.4.2 Persistence: The user's selected theme preference should be saved locally and applied automatically on subsequent visits.

3. Non-Functional Requirements
   3.1 User Interface & User Experience (UI/UX)
   3.1.1 Aesthetics: The application must have a beautiful, modern, and clean user interface, adhering to best practices in UI design.

3.1.2 Component Library: The UI will be built exclusively using Shadcn/UI components to ensure a consistent and high-quality look and feel.

3.1.3 Layout: The layout should be intuitive and responsive, providing an excellent experience on standard desktop screen sizes. A three-panel layout (Collections | Request | Response) is recommended.

3.1.4 Usability: The application should be easy to navigate and use. Interactive elements should have clear states (hover, focus, active).

3.2 Performance
3.2.1 Responsiveness: The UI should be fast and responsive, with no noticeable lag during user interactions.

3.2.2 Data Handling: As all data is local, operations like saving and loading requests should be instantaneous.

3.3 Data Storage
3.3.1 Local Storage: All user-generated data, including collections and saved requests, will be stored in the browser's local storage (localStorage). No backend database is required for this version.

4. Technology Stack
   Frontend Framework: React

UI Components: Shadcn/UI

Styling: Tailwind CSS

State Management: React Context or a lightweight state management library (e.g., Zustand).
